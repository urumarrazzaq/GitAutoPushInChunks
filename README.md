GitChunkPusher 🚀 – Smarter Way to Push Large Git Repositories



📌 Description
GitChunkPusher is a Python-based automation tool that helps developers push large repositories efficiently and intelligently. Instead of pushing all files at once, it divides the files into smaller chunks, preventing timeout errors and reducing resource consumption.

This tool also allows users to ignore specific folders, making it highly customizable for different project needs.

✨ Features
✅ Smart File Chunking – Push large repositories in smaller, manageable parts.
✅ Folder Ignore Option – Select folders to exclude from the push process.
✅ Responsive UI – Intuitive and scalable UI for a smooth experience.
✅ Selective File Commit – Commits files one by one instead of pushing the entire repo at once.
✅ Auto Git Setup – Automatically initializes Git and adds a remote if needed.
✅ Live Logs – Real-time logging for better monitoring.
