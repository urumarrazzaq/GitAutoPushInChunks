# GitAutoPushInChunks
GitChunkPusher is a Python-based automation tool that helps developers push large repositories efficiently and intelligently. Instead of pushing all files at once, it divides the files into smaller chunks, preventing timeout errors and reducing resource consumption. This Scripts helps to avoid LFS.
